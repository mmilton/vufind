; These are the default recommendations modules to use when no specific setting
; are found in the [TopRecommendations] or [SideRecommendations] sections below.
; See the comments above those sections for details on legal settings.  You may
; repeat these lines to load multiple recommendations.
;
; Right now, VuFind is configured to use Summon database recommendations at the
; top of the search results and all facets to the side.  You can reconfigure
; this by changing the default_top_recommend setting and [Facets] / [FacetsTop]
; sections below.
;default_top_recommend[] = TopFacets:FacetsTop:EDS

; be used to apply those filters to the next search you perform.  This setting

; The following two sections can be used to associate specific recommendations

; Summon as they do in the regular Search module.

; This section is reserved for special boolean facets.  These are displayed
; as checkboxes.  If the box is checked, the filter on the left side of the
; equal sign is applied.  If the box is not checked, the filter is not applied.
; The value on the right side of the equal sign is the text to display to the
; user.  It will be run through the translation code, so be sure to update the
; language files appropriately.
[CheckboxFacets]

; The order of display is as shown below
; The name of the index field is on the left
; The display name of the field is on the right

; The name of the index field may optionally be followed by comma-separated
; parameters (i.e. ",or,1,15") as defined by the Summon API.  Any provided 
; parameters will override defaults like the facet_limit setting in
; [Facet_Settings] below.
[Facets]

; These facets will be shown above search results if the TopFacets recommendations
; module is used, as opposed to the [Facets] section, which is shown to the side
